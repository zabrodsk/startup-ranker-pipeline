"""Parallel answering of all question trees.

This stage takes question trees for all 4 aspects and answers them
in parallel, then merges all Q&A pairs for use in argument generation.

Each tree is answered recursively:
- Leaf nodes use web search for research
- Parent nodes synthesize answers from children

Answered trees are cached to avoid redundant web searches.
